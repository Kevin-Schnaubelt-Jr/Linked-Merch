## Functionality

The user will be brought to their profile on sign up, and from there, they will generate a QR code with a chosen template. After which, they can browse the store and, before checkout, assign a QR code to that purchase.

## Data Model

The users model will need a model for storing the user's QR codes, as well as everything that goes with purchases (i.e purchase history). There will also need to be a model for admin to access what was purchases, by who, and with what QR code (unique site url) in order to integrate it into the order.

## Schedule

the First milestone will be a demo showing the ability to create custom QR codes with a user system, as well as the first initial template, which will just be emergency contact information.
