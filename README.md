## Project Overview

This website will provides users with the ability to purchase a range of items, including clothing and stickers, among other things. Each item purchased generates a unique QR code that will be displayed alongside the design of the product. The website will then automatically generate a personalized webpage that corresponds with the QR code and utilizes a template of the user's choice. Users can then access and edit their webpage, allowing them to create a customized digital platform to share with anyone who scans their item.

The potential uses of this platform are endless, from creating a business card that links to a more comprehensive online profile to a local artist selling stickers that redirect to their music or artwork gallery. Parents can even create custom shirts for their children that display emergency contact information. In addition, this platform offers businesses the ability to advertise their services with unique QR codes placed on clothing items, which customers can scan while waiting in line or browsing around. Ultimately, this website provides a user-friendly and accessible way for anyone to incorporate technology into their everyday items.

## Functionality

The homepage provides users with access to the marketplace, where they can browse available items. They can also sign up or log in to their account. Once logged in, users can access their profile page, where they can generate unique URL paths using a template of their choice. The website will provide both a link to the URL path and a QR code image associated with it, which can be saved and shared as desired. Users can edit the content on these pages to create a personalized digital platform.

Visitors who have access to the URL path or scan the QR code will be able to view the content that the user has added to their page.

When purchasing an item from the store, users will be prompted to select one of their generated QR codes to be associated with the item. The QR code will then be displayed on the item and shipped to the customer.

## Current State

Users can create an account have access to the ability to generate up to four unique QR codes. Once generated, these QR codes can be used to direct scanners to an emergency contact list that the user has populated with their own information. These codes are easily shareable and can be saved by the user via simple right click and save. When accessed, the QR code will redirect the scanner to the corresponding user-generated page, allowing them to access the information provided by the account holder.
